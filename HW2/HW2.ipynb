    "# Exercise 2: Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous exercise you implemented a binary classifier with one linear layer on a small portion of CIFAR-10. In this exercise, you will first implement a multi-class logistic regression model followed by a three layer neural network.\n",

    "## Submission guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Zip** all the files in the exercise directory excluding the data. Name the file `ex2_ID.zip`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Read the following instructions carefully:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. This jupyter notebook contains all the step by step instructions needed for this exercise.\n",
    "2. Write **efficient vectorized** code whenever possible. \n",
    "3. You are responsible for the correctness of your code and should add as many tests as you see fit. Tests will not be graded nor checked.\n",
    "4. Do not change the functions we provided you. \n",
    "4. Write your functions in the instructed python modules only. All the logic you write is imported and used using this jupyter notebook. You are allowed to add functions as long as they are located in the python modules and are imported properly.\n",
    "5. You are allowed to use functions and methods from the [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/) and [numpy](https://www.numpy.org/devdocs/reference/) only. Any other imports are forbidden.\n",
    "6. Your code must run without errors. Use `python 3` and `numpy 1.15.4`.\n",
    "7. **Before submitting the exercise, restart the kernel and run the notebook from start to finish to make sure everything works. Code that cannot run will not be tested.**\n",
    "8. Write your own code. Cheating will not be tolerated. \n",
    "9. Answers to qualitative questions should be written in **markdown** cells (with $\\LaTeX$ support)."

    "\n",
    "The implementation of linear regression was (hopefully) simple yet not very modular since the layer, loss and gradient were calculated as a single monolithic function. This would become impractical as we move towards bigger models. As a warmup towards `PyTorch`, we want to build networks using a more modular design so that we can implement different layer types in isolation and easily integrate them together into models with different architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "This logic of isolation & integration is at the heart of all popular deep learning frameworks, and is based on two methods each layer holds - a forward and backward pass. The forward function will receive inputs, weights and other parameters and will return both an output and a cache object storing data needed for the backward pass. The backward pass will receive upstream derivatives and the cache, and will return gradients with respect to the inputs and weights. By implementing several types of layers this way, we will be able to easily combine them to build classifiers with different architectures with relative ease.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will implement a neural network to obtain better results on CIFAR-10. If you were careful, you should have got a classification accuracy of over 38% on the test set using a simple single layer network. However, using multiple layers we could reach around 50% accuracy. Our neural network will be implemented in the file `functions/neural_net.py`. We will train this network using softmax loss and L2 regularization and a ReLU non-linearity after the first two fully connected layers.\n",
